Version 1.3 1/10/18:
  Moved the program over to github, let the very slow process begin.
  Began laying out the framework for the site, going to need to find a wayto work on this while at school if at all possible.

Verion 1.2 1/10/18:
  This is less of an update about the content of the program and more an update of where this program will be going.
  While repl.it has served me quite well, I find that a text terminal does not allow for a very user friendly experience. Because of this, I will be converting into a website usin github pages.
  The site will be available at https://AvisTonitrui.github.io/Warfarm (please note hat the site is case sensitive)
  With a website, I will hopefully be able to dliver an experience much more user friendly and make it even easier for you to optimize your prime farming.
  This will not be a short process, as I have to change programming languages and also make the whole program more web compatible. I will update this repl once I have gotten the site into a working state.
  In the meantime, this program will remain up and completely usable. However, all future updates will only be available via th site.
